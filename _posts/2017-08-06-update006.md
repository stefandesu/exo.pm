Welcome back!

I basically have non-stop visits from friends at the moment, so there's not too much to say.

My friend and I went on a little hike today, what a beautiful day it was. ☺️

## Month of Discipline Update
You may have seen that I have started what I call the [month of discipline](/monthofdiscipline/). I have to admit that I haven't actively worked on it too much, but I have had some really good work sessions and actually worked a whole lot on a task that I've been pushing back. I have also spent a lot of (way too much) time on a job application that I've submitted this morning. So in total, I'm really happy with how the first few days went.

## KUID
Kansai University International Dormitory - that's the name of the dorm I lived in when I was in Japan for my exchange semester. I recently stumbled upon the [entry on Google for the dorm](https://www.google.de/maps/place/関西大学+南千里国際学生寮+Kansai+University+International+Dormitory/@34.7982866,135.5077549,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x50b664209ffb410b!8m2!3d34.7982866!4d135.5099436!9m1!1b1) and found out that it has five 5-star ratings, at least three of which are from people I know. I can only agree with them, although I think that it depends so much on the kind of people who are there with you. In our semester, there were so many nice and kind and fun people that no matter what kind of dormitory it is, you're going to have a great time. Thanks again everyone, I miss you! ❤️

## Canabalt
Seven or eight years ago, we played an awesome game called "Canabalt" on my friend's iPod touch and tried to beat each other's records. This game still exists and the main mode is still exactly the same. It came back to my attention because it was updated to 64 bit which means it will still be compatible with the newest iOS update. It also made me install it again and today I randomly had a really good run and beat my old record by a lot! It has AWESOME music by the way!

This is the most watched non-music video on YouTube. I don't know how this came to be, but I think it's kind of funny. 😁

This is a really interesting approach in answering the question on "How to Vlog". Basically what he's saying is that people are watching for the PERSON and not because of the adventures and beautiful cinematography and stuff. Of course all of that helps, but especially for vlogs you need to just be yourself and try to show the things that YOU are excited about. I like Peter a lot and can really recommend his videos!

Okay, I haven't actually watched this yet, but this video HAS TO BE awesome! This guy is amazing, I love his videos!
