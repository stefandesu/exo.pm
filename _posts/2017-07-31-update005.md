Hi there!

Will I ever be on time with these? At least it's only one day late. 😅

## Running Updates
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My running goal for this month were 100 km. It’s still a whole week left in July and I already got it! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/ZJsmGd75YK">pic.twitter.com/ZJsmGd75YK</a></p>&mdash; Stefan (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/889392672628236289">July 24, 2017</a></blockquote>

First of all, a day after the last post, I reached my 100 km goal for the month of July! I would never have thought to reach it early, but that one 17 km run did the job. The only issue was that I started having some issues with my right ankle, so for the subsequent runs, I usually only ran a single lap. It would have been sensible to take a break, but I really wanted to get the one month streak. So, with mostly short 1.5 km runs, I achieved this and can now say that I ran every day in the month of July, 2017! 

But now, I'll really take a break so that my ankle can heal properly. It's not TOO bad, but it didn't get better over the last week.

I still have it on my mind to run a half marathon in September. I think the registration is pretty flexible, so I can see how it'll go over the next two to three weeks.

## New Logo!
My flatmate created an awesome little logo for me! I think it fits so well with the style of this blog, it is cute, and it represents my interests.

Go check her out on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/die_salo/) (warning: it's full of 🐈🐈 and 🐕🐕).

## Other Blog Updates
Of course, I couldn't stop tinkering with other aspects of the blog as well. What happened was that I tried to optimize everything out of it to minimize the page size and loading times. I cut out most of JavaScript (especially everything jQuery so I don't have to load the library) and replaced the full FontAwesome font with a custom one that just includes the icons I need. Now, the front page of my blog is only about 22 kB in size **in total**.

(Of course, all the posts and pages that include photos or images are much larger than that.)

## 照れる
While studying a new kanji (照) I saw the following sentence in the examples:

I feel like that's so typical Japanese... 😆

This is such a stupid Apple thing to make, but I enjoyed it very much. Very well made and entertaining.

But the big question: Can The Rock actually use Siri like that? Spoiler: More or less.

A REALLY good watch! One of Casey's best videos ever I think.

This is SO stupid, but mega funny. 😂

It's kind of mean to laugh about this, but as the guy is making fun of himself (and maybe even doing this on purpose), I think it's fair to find this funny. 😁

## Tweets

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hard to describe how it feels that I managed to motivate even just one person to go running again. Go <a href="https://twitter.com/xHardysX">@xHardysX</a> go! 🎉 <a href="https://t.co/Hy84dHJ4ml">https://t.co/Hy84dHJ4ml</a></p>&mdash; Stefan (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/889584333668974599">July 24, 2017</a></blockquote>Motivated a friend of mine to go running again, great feeling!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Going for a shower. I mean a run.

We are all worrying way too much. 🙃

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had a dream about being back in Japan, but there were mostly gaijins. 😱</p>&mdash; Stefan (@stefandesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefandesu/status/891228039081754625">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote>What a nightmare. I would die if I finally went back to Japan and there were barely any Japanese people left. 😭

# Well...
I really need to start to make more notes throughout the week for these posts. But maybe you actually appreciate if they aren't too long anyway. 😉 See you next week!
